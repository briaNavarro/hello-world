# hello-world

Hello there, 

My name is Brian Navarro, I am startig a new career path, I recently saw a Barcelona soccer game live, and I have three dogs. 
I chose to persure a career in web development, so I changed my focus on to the subject and want to gain the experience needed in order to obtain a job.
